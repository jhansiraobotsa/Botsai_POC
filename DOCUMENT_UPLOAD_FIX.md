# Document Upload Fix - Session-Only Display

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

### **Issue:**
When uploading documents, you were seeing OLD documents from previous sessions instead of only the documents you just uploaded.

**Example:**
- You upload `digital-sat-sample-questions.pdf`
- But you see `cybersecuirty_sb_factsheets_all (1).pdf` from last week
- Confusing! ❌

### **Root Cause:**
Documents were being saved to `localStorage` and persisting across browser sessions. Every time you opened the page, it would load all the old documents you ever uploaded.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Removed localStorage Persistence**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Loaded old documents from localStorage
const [uploadedFiles, setUploadedFiles] = useState(() => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem(`uploadedFiles_${chatbotId}`);
  return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];  // ❌ Shows old docs
});

// Saved to localStorage on every change
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem(`uploadedFiles_${chatbotId}`, JSON.stringify(uploadedFiles));
}, [uploadedFiles]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Fresh start every session
const [uploadedFiles, setUploadedFiles] = useState([]);
// ✅ No localStorage, no old documents!
```

### **2. Added "Clear All" Button**

Now you can easily clear the uploaded documents list with one click:
- Shows document count: "Current session uploads • 2 documents"
- Red "Clear All" button appears when you have uploaded files
- One click to clear everything

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Fresh Session Every Time:**
```
1. Open chatbot details page
   ↓
2. Uploaded Documents list is EMPTY ✅
   ↓
3. Upload a document (e.g., "report.pdf")
   ↓
4. See ONLY "report.pdf" in the list ✅
   ↓
5. Upload another document (e.g., "data.xlsx")
   ↓
6. See ONLY current session uploads:
   - report.pdf (Just now)
   - data.xlsx (Just now) ✅
   ↓
7. Refresh page or come back tomorrow
   ↓
8. List is EMPTY again (fresh start) ✅
```

### **What You'll See:**

**Uploaded Documents Header:**
```
Uploaded Documents                              [Clear All]
Current session uploads • 2 documents
```

**Document List:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📄 digital-sat-sample-questions.pdf         │
│    525.6 KB • Just now            [✓][×]    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 report-2024.pdf                          │
│    3 MB • 5m ago                  [✓][×]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Empty State (when no uploads):**
```
No documents uploaded in this session yet.
Upload documents using the form above.
```

## 💡 Why This Is Better

### **Before (With localStorage):**
- ❌ Confusing: Shows documents from weeks ago
- ❌ Clutter: List keeps growing forever
- ❌ Misleading: Can't tell what's current vs old
- ❌ No way to clear old documents

### **After (Session-Only):**
- ✅ Clear: Only shows current session uploads
- ✅ Clean: Fresh start each time
- ✅ Accurate: Know exactly what you just uploaded
- ✅ Easy to clear: "Clear All" button

## 🔧 Additional Features

### **1. Individual Document Removal**
Each document has an [×] button:
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  setUploadedFiles(prev => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  // Shows toast: "Document Removed"
}}
```

### **2. Clear All Documents**
Button in header:
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  setUploadedFiles([]);
  // Shows toast: "All Documents Cleared"
}}
```

### **3. Document Count**
Shows how many documents in current session:
```
Current session uploads • 3 documents
```

### **4. Time Tracking**
Shows when each document was uploaded:
- "Just now" (< 1 min)
- "5m ago" (< 1 hour)
- "2h ago" (< 1 day)
- "3d ago" (> 1 day)

## 📊 What Gets Stored vs What Doesn't

### **✅ Still Stored in Backend:**
- Actual document content
- Vector embeddings
- Document metadata
- Chatbot knowledge base

### **❌ No Longer Stored in Frontend:**
- Upload history in localStorage
- Old document list
- Previous session data

**Result:** Backend has all the actual data, frontend just shows what you uploaded RIGHT NOW.

---

## 🎯 Summary

**What Changed:**
1. ✅ Removed localStorage persistence for uploaded documents
2. ✅ Documents list now resets every session
3. ✅ Added "Clear All" button
4. ✅ Added document count display
5. ✅ Cleaner, more accurate display

**What This Means:**
- You see ONLY what you upload in the current session
- No more confusion with old documents
- Fresh, clean list every time
- Easy to clear with one click

**What Stays the Same:**
- Documents are still processed and stored in backend
- Chatbot still uses all uploaded documents
- Vector embeddings still work
- Knowledge base is still built correctly

**The uploaded documents list is now just a "Current Session" indicator, not a permanent history!** ✅

## 🐛 If You Still See Old Documents

### **Clear Browser Cache:**
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Del
2. Clear "Cached images and files"
3. Clear "Cookies and site data"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh page
```

### **Or:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

This will remove any old localStorage data and start fresh!
